On submission the RFQ will remain open for a given amount of time for the vendors chosen by the customers. Vendors will provide their prices and any supporting documents as the reply to the RFQ with in the time. Customer choses the most suitable RFQ response and can add products to cart on vendor provided prices.</dd>
     			<dt>Subscription Product Type Extension</dt>
     			<dd>Another project requirement working with my previous employer. Aim was to introduce a new product type Subscription. It was a complex product that can have other type of products as child products like Grouped or Configurable products. Product page of such product will show subscription terms and subscription items and a start date as a required field in add to cart form. An active subscription had renew or de-activate funcionality in back-end.</dd>

The aim was to develop a Import mechanism to import properties form various Vendor sources having ongoing bids for acquisition. These imported properties data was refined using address verification service and the google and bing map services for accurate address and property condition information. Which was later used in the due-diligence to find out the proper bid based on the historical data in the system and the manual expertise.</dd>
     			<dt>Ciesse-piumini and Westscout webshops</dt>
     			<dd>Developed when working with my previous employer. Aim was to develop twin but having contrast theme Magento shops.
